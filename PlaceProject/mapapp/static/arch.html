    The Neyveli Arch Gate is one of the most iconic entry points into Neyveli Township. Located along the main approach road, this arch serves as a symbolic landmark welcoming visitors into the industrial city developed by NLC India Limited. It represents the beginning of the Neyveli township region which is known for its coal mining, power generation, planned housing blocks and educational institutions. The arch is not only a navigation marker for travellers but also a photo spot and a cultural landmark for the people of Neyveli, signifying pride, identity and the unique character of the town.
