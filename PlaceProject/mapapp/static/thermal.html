    The New Thermal Power Station at Neyveli, also known as Neyveli New Thermal Power Station (NNTPP), is a modern coal-based power plant built as part of NLC India Limited’s expansion project. It has a total installed capacity of 2 × 500 MW (1000 MW) and was developed to replace older units with advanced supercritical technology that reduces emissions and improves energy efficiency. This station plays a major role in supplying electricity to Tamil Nadu and neighbouring states, and continues to support industrial growth, infrastructure development and the overall power demand of the region.
